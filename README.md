Popcycle
========
**Popcycle** is an R package that offers a reproducible approach to process, calibrate and curate flow cytometry data collected by SeaFlow.

Since 2010, we have operated SeaFlow for 14,000 hours across 140,000 km of ocean, collecting over 300,000 samples in surface waters. We have created Popcycle, an R package that use reproducible analytical methods to uniformly process and curate SeaFlow data. The current datasets consist of cell abundance, cell diameter and cellular carbon content of small phytoplankton (< 10 Î¼m), which includes the cyanobacteria <i>Prochlorococcus</i>, <i>Synechococcus</i> and <i>Crocosphaera</i>, and a mixture of unindentified protists.

Raw  data are stored every 3 minutes in a custom binary file format (RAW data) consisting of eight 16-bit integer channels, along with [metadata](https://github.com/armbrustlab/seaflow-sfl) provided by the ship's data system (e.g., time, location, sea surface temperature, salinity, light intensity). The files are stored in day-of-year-labeled directories, each containing raw files with the associated log file. 

**Popcycle** performs 3 key analyses:
1. ```Gating```: Classification of phytoplankton cell populations using a mixture of manual gating and a semi-supervized clusterting algorithm.
2. ```Light scatter conversion```: Convert light scattering of each particle to [carbon content](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-poc-calibration) and [cell diameter](https://github.com/armbrustlab/fsc-size-calibration).
3. ```PER POPULATION data```: Perform aggregate statistics along with error propagation for the different populations.
The cell population identification (GATED data) and diameter and carbon content (CALIBRATED data) of each OPP are saved as separate text files with a similar file structure as the RAW data. The metadata, gating scheme, and aggregated statistics for each step are saved to a SQL database using SQLite3.

### Install
In this project's directory, run the install script `setup.R`. This will install `devtools`, `BiocManager`, and any dependencies listed in `DESCRIPTION`. It will not upgrade any packages. To upgrade dependencies, manually run the install commands in `setup.R` in an interactive R environment making sure to set install options for upgrading or updating appropriately.

```
Rscript setup.R
```
